# Requirements Quality Checklist: AI Resource Landing Page

**Purpose**: Unit tests for the written requirements (completeness/clarity/consistency/measurability) before implementation.
**Created**: 2026-01-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Scope (Q1)**: UX + backend API contract + transcript persistence
**Strictness (Q2)**: Standard
**Priority Risk Area (Q3)**: Accessibility + motion + contrast

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements (including the project constitution).

**How to use**:
- Check an item when the requirement is unambiguous and testable across the written artifacts (spec/plan/contracts/tasks).
- If an item reveals a gap, prefer fixing it in [spec.md](../spec.md) first, then follow through in [plan.md](../plan.md), [tasks.md](../tasks.md), and [contracts/openapi.yaml](../contracts/openapi.yaml) as needed.

## Priority Gate (Must Resolve): Accessibility, Motion & Contrast

- [x] CHK039 Is there an explicit definition of the keyboard-only primary flows (search → open result; chat → send; clear/restart; optional save) and what “done” means for each flow? [Priority, Spec §AC-015; Spec §FR-011; Spec §FR-017]
- [x] CHK040 Are focus indicators required to be visible in both light and dark modes (including focus ring color contrast and not being clipped/hidden by overflow)? [Priority, Spec §Accessibility Guidelines; Spec §Dark Mode]
- [x] CHK041 Are contrast requirements specified beyond body text (e.g., borders, disabled states, helper/error text, icon-only buttons, and focus rings)? [Priority, Spec §Accessibility Guidelines]
- [x] CHK042 Are reduced-motion expectations stated in implementable terms (what must stop under prefers-reduced-motion, and what is allowed to remain for usability like loading indicators)? [Priority, Spec §Motion Guidelines]
- [x] CHK043 Are hover/active/focus states specified to avoid layout shift and preserve readability (e.g., use outline/shadow/border color changes, not size changes)? [Priority, Spec §Component Behavior & States; Spec §Interaction & Feedback]
- [x] CHK044 Are “no color alone” indicators explicitly required for all relevant status UI (empty/error/success/loading) rather than only mentioned as a guideline? [Priority, Spec §Accessibility Guidelines]

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK001 Are all primary landing-page entry points explicitly required (Search, Chat, Browse, Contribute, theme control) rather than implied? [Completeness, Spec §Page Structure (Landing Pattern)]
- [x] CHK002 Are requirements defined for serving the landing page at `/` and any redirects/legacy home behavior? [Completeness, Spec §FR-018; Spec §Routing Notes]
- [x] CHK003 Are the minimum data fields for “resource preview” explicitly specified (beyond title + short summary), or intentionally constrained to only those? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004; Spec §Search Results]
- [x] CHK004 Are requirements specified for signed-out chat attempts (what the user sees, what CTAs exist, and what fallback is recommended)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-016; Spec §User Story 2 Acceptance Scenarios]
- [x] CHK005 Are requirements defined for chat persistence boundaries (when transcripts are created, what “explicit save” means, and whether unsaved chat remains session-only)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-017]
- [x] CHK006 Are requirements specified for how “featured topics/categories” are chosen and maintained (static list vs data-driven, and ownership of the content)? [Gap]
- [x] CHK007 Are requirements specified for the “social proof” section’s presence/absence rules (optional vs required, and acceptable alternatives)? [Completeness, Spec §Page Structure (Landing Pattern)]

## Requirement Clarity

- [x] CHK009 Is the definition of “summary/description” unambiguous (which field(s) are searched and displayed in results)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-019; Spec §FR-004]
- [x] CHK010 Is “prominent keyword search entry point” quantified (placement, default focus behavior if any, visibility without scrolling, and responsive rules)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-002; Spec §AC-002]
- [x] CHK011 Is “friendly error state” defined with required attributes (tone guidelines, specificity, retry affordance, and fallback suggestions)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-008; Spec §Interaction & Feedback]
- [x] CHK012 Is the chat assistant’s grounding rule clearly specified (what constitutes “recommend resources that exist”, and required behavior when uncertain)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007; Spec §AC-007]
- [x] CHK013 Is the “reduced motion” requirement specific enough to implement consistently (what is considered “decorative”, what must remain, and examples of disallowed motion)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-013; Spec §Motion Guidelines]

## Requirement Consistency

- [x] CHK014 Do the functional requirements and UI/UX spec agree on chat eligibility (signed-in only) and the exact fallback behavior when signed out? [Consistency, Spec §FR-016; Spec §Chat]
- [x] CHK015 Do loading and timing expectations align across sections (e.g., “loading indicator within 250ms” vs performance goals “within 2s/5s”)? [Consistency, Spec §Interaction & Feedback; Spec §SC-002; Spec §SC-003; Plan §Performance Goals]
- [x] CHK016 Are icon requirements consistent across the spec (no emoji icons + consistent icon set) and any referenced UI libraries/assumptions? [Consistency, Spec §FR-014]
- [x] CHK017 Are keyboard accessibility requirements consistent between FR/AC and the UI/UX accessibility guidelines (scope of “primary flows” and expectations)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-015; Spec §AC-015; Spec §Accessibility Guidelines]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [x] CHK018 Do acceptance criteria cover each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-020) without gaps or ambiguous mapping? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §Functional Requirements; Spec §Acceptance Criteria]
